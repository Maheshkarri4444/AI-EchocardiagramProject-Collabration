# Project Collaboration and Overview:

I collaborated with three talented team members to develop the CardioLens project. This AI-powered solution automates Echocardiogram Segmentation and generates detailed reports using Intel Optimized Models for medical image analysis.

While the core research and AI model development were handled by the team, my role was to design and develop the frontend and backend for the project. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the system, and the backend manages video uploads, data processing, and integration with the segmentation models.

# Hackathon Details:
 [Intel® AI Hackathon @ IEEE IndiCon 2024](http://ieeeindicon.org/)
 
Intel® AI Hackathon is an AI Readiness focused initiative for next-generation technologists from higher education institutions in India, offering them an opportunity to showcase AI innovation and impact. IEEE and IIT-Kharagpur join hands with Intel to bring this opportunity for students participating in IEEE INDICON 2024, being held at IIT-Kharagpur this year (2024).


# Brief Overview:

Our project focuses on leveraging the *Intel AI technologies* and Deep Learning frameworks to optimize and automate *Medical Image Segmentation* and *Ejection fraction calculation* from Echocardiogram videos. By utilizing *Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX), we enhanced the performance of **PyTorch models* by running on *Intel CPUs and GPUs*, accelerating both training and inference tasks.
